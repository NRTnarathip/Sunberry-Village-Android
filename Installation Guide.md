# Configuration
- **"FestivalPatches":** The possible values for this are "true" and "false". If set to "false", it disables festival patches but keeps the NPCs where they are. Only disable if you run into a visual issue/incompatibility that annoys you. 
- **"BoardUnlock":** The possible values for this are "Vanilla" and "Elias". Toggles whether you want the Sunberry special order board to unlock when the vanilla special orders board unlocks, or when any player reaches 4 hearts with Elias.
- **"IncludeNPCsInPerfection":** The possible values for this are "true" and "false". Toggles whether or not Sunberry Village NPCs count towards perfection. True by default. Set to false if you don't want them to count.
