Thank you to all the people listed above and my wonderful friends. Yo**u** k**n**ow who you **a**re ;) Thank you for holding my hand through all this, for sharing your invaluable ideas, suggestions, and feedback, for managing to scope creep me in the best way possible. This project would not be where it it today if it weren't for you all.
A final thank you for sophie and Airyn, who supported me through the entirety of this project from start to finish, whether they were helping out with the mod, the server, or just being the wonderful, supportive people they are.
